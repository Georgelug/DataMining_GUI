# Data Mining GUI

## Introduction
In this project, a system will be designed and implemented where, on the Backend side, the data is obtained, it is purified, models are obtained based on algorithms seen in class, so that based on this, it is possible, on the Frontend side, to visualize the integration of the data, as well as the graphic implementation of these models.

## Requirements
- **Functional**: Get the data, debug it, implement it in algorithms to get models and display the data and models on the Frontend side.
- **Not Functionala**: For the backend side, Flask will be used, the Python framework, the modules used during the data mining course, for the frontend part javascript, html and CSS will be used, however, if React was planned to be used but if possible, the use of the Vue.js framework will be implemented due to its simplicity to implement the GUI and others that may allow the graphical display of the models.
